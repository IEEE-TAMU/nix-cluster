# Hardware

This directory contains hardware specific configurations for use with [nixos-facter](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-facter).

To generate a new hardware definition, either use `nixos-facter` directly on the machine you would like to generate the definition for or the `--generate-hardware-config nixos-facter` option in the `nixos-anywhere` command.
